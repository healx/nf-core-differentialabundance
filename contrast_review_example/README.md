# Contrast review reporting

The files here just explore how we might generate contrast review slides from gene expression outputs.

This would only be possible for heuristics attainable from the expression data:

 - Biomarkers etc in differntial gene sets
 - Numbers of differential genes
 - Pathways of interest differential
 - Metabolic genes (could presumably do via gene set annotations)


It would not work for things available elsewhere, e.g. mapping statistics.
